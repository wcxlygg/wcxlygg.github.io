Zebrafish is a powerful vertebrate model organism. Despite recent success in the automatic quantification of adult zebrafish movement, it remains a laborious task for group zebrafish larval tracking due to their similar appearance, frequent occlusions, and highly discontinuous kinematics. This paper presents DanioSense, an automatic tracker for group larval zebrafish, to overcome these tracking challenges. The integration of a light convolutional neural network and a centerline extraction algorithm enables the tracker to localize individuals even in occlusion cases where objects‚Äô identities are prone to switch. With reliable detections, an Adaptive Kalman Filter is designed to optimally estimate locomotive parameters, which is also used for object reidentification accomplished by a two-stage data association protocol. Experimental results demonstrated a tracking accuracy of over 97%, median errors of 102 ¬µm, and 8.8‚ó¶ for the position and orientation measurement respectively, and a processing speed of over 30 frames per second with a normal computer configuration. DanioSense provides detailed quantitative data for a large-scale larvae group in nearly real time, highly boosting the efficiency of characterizing individual phenotypes and analyzing social interactions.","tags":["Under Review","Automated measurement","Multiple-object Tracking","CNN"],"title":"DanioSense Automated High-throughput Quantification of Zebrafish Larvae Group Movement   (under review)","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Video tracking has become a standard procedure for studying model organisms' functional characteristics, during which the trajectory of each animal and their corresponding movement information are extracted for a range of biomedical studies, such as genetics, drug discovery, toxicology, behavioral science, etc. Manual tracking via frame-by-frame labeling is time-consuming, subjective, and tedious, whose results are often not consistent due to the fatigue and inexperience of operators. Therefore, an automatic tracking system is indispensable, which achieves a remarkedly higher research output and provides more insightful and detailed statistics.\nZebrafish larva stands out as a popular vertebrate model organism for large-scale chemical and genetic screens due to its high similarity of gene and cardiovascular system to human, optical transparency, easiness of acquisition, and rapid developmental process. Compared with other experimental organisms of zebrafish, larval motility, along with the transparent morphology, implies more phenotypic information than cells and embryos. Unlike adult zebrafish, larval relative transparency and immature nervous system allow detailed studies of gene regulation and function and neuropharmacological studies that cannot be performed in the adult period. Researchers generally transfer foreign materials into zebrafish embryos or specific organs of zebrafish larvae after which larval locomotive behaviors are recorded for further analysis. These investigations cover the fields of the analysis of movement characteristics, social behavior, and the assessment of phenotypes resulting from: gene knockdown approaches, genetic mutations, drugs, etc.\nMany single and multiple object tracking systems have been developed for adult zebrafish, reporting outstanding tracking performance. However, their performance dramatically drops when applied to a larvae group, where individuals' identities switch easily, and thus the statistical data is not usable. This weakeness highly limits the efficiency of relevant biomedical research. Over an extended period, tracking a larval zebrafish group is a labor-consuming manual work due to these systems‚Äô inability to generate reliable results.\nIt is small size, transparent and similar appearance, frequent occlusions, and discontinuous kinematics that combine to make larval tracking notoriously difficult. Small size makes a multiple-sensor tracking system and labeling approaches infeasible due to imaging and operating constraints. Transparent and similar appearance causes tracking algorithms based on extracting superficial appearance features to fail, as the difference between larvae‚Äôs appearance is much less distinguishable than that of adult fish.\nOcclusion is a general, and the toughest tracking difficulty since occluded targets are recognized as a single connected component in image, and their identities may switch after the point of overlap. This issue can be corrected according to motion continuity. However, different from the adult‚Äôs continual pattern of swimming, larvae can stay static over a long period and then flick, which is referred to as oscillatory movements. This locomotive characteristic, along with larva\u0026rsquo;s abruptly switched swim modes yields to a long-lasting occlusion where larvae can change their motion stochastically. This results in the poor performance of systems that calculate the most likely assignment of identities before and after an occlusion based on continuous motion models and body geometry.\nPresently, confronted with these tracking difficulties for larvae, the most widely-used workaround is to segregate single larva in multiwell plates physically. Another state-of-the-art solution, the well-known idTracker.ai, takes advantage of the powerful feature extracting capability of deep learning to identify objects individually. Besides, ZebraZoom and Wang et al. use background subtraction to segment and track larvae. Under certain circumstances, these methods work quite well, whereas it still seems that they have their limitations. Strictly limiting experiments to one zebrafish per dish constrains the research application as group behavior investigations, for example, cannot be performed. idTracker.ai is computationally and memory expensive, and requires a whole recording to train the neural network, which disables this method to fit in real-time, streaming applications. ZebraZoom and the method proposed by Wang et al. is only capable of processing a restricted number of larvae ($\u0026lt;$10) as their capability to tackle the occlusion problem is limited.\nThis project proposed DanioSense, an efficient, robust, and high-throughput tracking system to automate the quantification of zebrafish larvae group movement. The task of tracking group larval zebrafish is to\n discover multiple objects in individual frames;  maintain the identity information across continuous frames;  yield their trajectories while recording the statistical parameters.   The main contributions of this work include\n resolving the occlusion problem to obtain reliable trajectories with a light pre-trained convolutional neural network and a centerline extraction algorithm;  handling the discontinuous kinematics by an Adaptive Kalman Filter to obtain the optimal estimation of larvae‚Äôs locomotive parameters;  adopting an enriched vector instead of a point to generate more detailed morphology and movement statistics;  providing a variety of tracking visualization functions that offers users an intuitive sense of larval movements. In addition, DanioSense is applicable to the behavior quantification of other fish-like animals, only requiring users to upload their own datasets and retrain the convolutional neural network classifier.

The presented method consists of two parts: adaptive coordinate transformation and curve evolution for edge detection. In the first part, the impact of refraction is taken into consideration. An adaptive calibration method is developed, which enables the coordinate transformation matrix to adapt to the changing water depth. In the second part, the abovementioned calibration result is used to keep the injection pipette tip descending along the desired route. A curve-evolution-based edge detection algorithm is introduced to detect the deformation of larva skin caused by contact with the injection pipette tip. Experimental results demonstrate that high accuracy and success rates are achieved. The effect of uncertainties caused by water-depth variation and the skill requirement in manual manipulation are eliminated.

Drive the mechanical device to adjust the object to the ideal orientation. Inhale the larva into the pipette and position it to the desired position. The micromanipulator moves the pipette to the releasing position. Release larva.  The difficulties include:\n Abrupt motion in the process of aspiration or dispensing, as illustrated in the following video:  Sensitive dynamic characteristics when positioning the object, shown in the video below:  Difficulties for video tracking, including the abruptive motion, objects that are out of focus and blocked up, etc.   To deal with the object‚Äôs abrupt motion, defocus, occlusion problems, a fast and reliable tracker is designed, achieving a processing velocity of over 100 frames per second and an locating accuracy within 5 pixels.\nTo model the background, an adapted Gaussian Mixture model is adopted, with equations as follows:\n\\[p\\left( {\\vec x|{\\chi _T},BG + FG} \\right) = \\sum\\limits_{m = 1}^M {{\\pi _m}} {\\rm{N}}\\left( {\\vec x;\\overrightarrow {{\\mu _m}} ,\\sigma _m^2*I} \\right) \\]\n\\[\\begin{array}{*{20}{c}} {\\pi _m^\\prime = {\\pi _m} + \\alpha \\left( {O_m^t - {\\pi _m}} \\right)}\\\\ {\\vec \\mu _m^\\prime = {{\\vec \\mu }_m} + O_m^t\\left( {\\alpha /{\\pi _m}} \\right){{\\vec \\delta }_m}}\\\\ {\\sigma _m^{{2^\\prime }} = \\sigma _m^2 + O_m^t\\left( {\\alpha /{\\pi _m}} \\right)\\left( {\\vec \\delta _m^T{\\delta _m} - \\sigma _m^2} \\right)} \\end{array}\\]\nAfter that, subtract the frame from the background, and then the Otsu thresholding method, along with morphological operations, is performed to segment the whole contour. With the contour, the larval position is calculated, shown in the video below. \nTo model this system, the force analysis is conducted as follows: \n\\[\\begin{array}{*{20}{l}} {m{{\\ddot x}_w} + b{{\\dot x}_w} + G\\sin \\theta = {P_0}{S_{pip}} - \\frac{{{P_{air,0}}{V_{air,0}}}}{{{V_{air,0}} + u{S_{pis}} - {x_w}{S_{pip}}}}{S_{pip}}}\\\\ {m{{\\ddot x}_w} + b{{\\dot x}_w} + G\\sin \\theta = \\frac{{{P_0}{S_{pip}}{V_{air,0}} + {P_0}{S_{pip}}{S_{pis}}u - {P_0}S_{pip}^2{x_w} - {P_{air,0}}{V_{air,0}}{S_{pip}}}}{{{V_{air,0}} + u{S_{pis}} - {x_w}{S_{pip}}}}}\\\\ {m{{\\ddot x}_w} + b{{\\dot x}_w} + G\\sin \\theta = \\frac{{{P_0}{S_{pip}}{V_{air,0}} + {P_0}{S_{pip}}{S_{pis}}u - {P_0}S_{pip}^2{x_w} - {P_{air,0}}{V_{air,0}}{S_{pip}}}}{{{V_{air,0}}}}}\\\\ {m{{\\ddot x}_w} + b{{\\dot x}_w} + \\frac{{{P_0}S_{pip}^2}}{{{V_{air,0}}}}{x_w} + G\\sin \\theta = \\frac{{{P_0}{S_{pip}}{S_{pis}}}}{{{V_{air,0}}}}u + \\left( {{P_0} - {P_{air,0}}} \\right){S_{pip}}} \\end{array}\\]\nBuild the dynamic model:\n\\[\\begin{array}{*{20}{l}} {m\\ddot x + K\\ddot x + \\frac{K}{b}\\frac{{{P_0}S_{pip}^2}}{{{V_{air,0}}}}\\left( {\\frac{{m\\ddot x + G\\sin \\theta }}{K} + \\dot x} \\right) = \\frac{{K{P_0}{S_{pp}}{S_{pis}}}}{{b{V_{air,0}}}}u}\\\\ {m\\ddot x + K\\ddot x + \\frac{K}{b}\\frac{{{P_0}S_{pip}^2}}{{{V_{air,0}}}}\\frac{m}{K}\\ddot x + \\frac{K}{b}\\frac{{{P_0}S_{pip}^2}}{{{V_{air,0}}}}\\frac{{G\\sin \\theta }}{K} + \\frac{K}{b}\\frac{{{P_0}S_{pip}^2}}{{{V_{air,0}}}}\\dot x = \\frac{{K{P_0}{S_{pip}}{S_{pis}}}}{{b{V_{air,0}}}}u}\\\\ {m\\ddot x + \\left( {\\frac{{m{P_0}S_{pp}^2}}{{b{V_{air,0}}}} + K} \\right)\\ddot x + \\frac{{K{P_0}S_{pip}^2}}{{b{V_{air,0}}}}\\dot x + \\frac{{{P_0}S_{pip}^2G\\sin \\theta }}{{b{V_{ijr,0}}}} = \\frac{{K{P_0}{S_{pip}}{S_{pis}}}}{{b{V_{air,0}}}}u} \\end{array}\\]\nAbbreviate it in the fllowing form:\n\\[{a_1}\\ddot x + {a_2}\\ddot x + {a_3}\\dot x + {a_4} = bu\\]\nThe parameters of the dynamic model are identified by the frequency response test, after which the PID control algorithm is desinged, achieving the following control effect: \nThis system manages to position a larva to a desired position in the inclined micropipette for larva transfer and manipulation, which could hardly be achieved manually. Presently, the PID control effect is not optimal for larvae with different ages. Thus, I have been working on using the Adaptive Robust control to enhance the control performance, and extend its application to other organisms, such as embryo. I plan to write a paper and submit it to IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering.\n Supervisor: Prof. Huijun Gao, IEEE Fellow and Professor of Department of Automation, Harbin Institute of Technology\n","date":1575244800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1575244800,"objectID":"081c7e2465d5b3a454bc4cf4e709de73","permalink":"https://luoyeguigenno1.github.io/project/zebrafish-larva-positioning-system/","publishdate":"2019-12-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/zebrafish-larva-positioning-system/","section":"project","summary":"In this project, a complete zebrafish larva positioning system was designed, including hardware, software, visual feedback algorithm, and control algorithm.","tags":["Computer Vision","Robotics","Control"],"title":"Zebrafish Larva Positioning System","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Larva yolk deformation tracking This algorithm uses optical flow to track the deformation of the zebrafish larva yolk, which serves as a visual feedback module for larva yolk soft capture.\n Cell counting This algorithm automates the task of counting the number of cells in the stem cell culture apparatus.

For this reason, I played this song with Kalimba. \nPlot In a mystical realm that exists beneath the human world, populated by magical-powered beings, a girl named Chun participates in a coming-of-age ritual where she is transported through a portal of water to experience the human world in the form of a red dolphin. There, she encounters a human boy who lives by the sea and reveres aquatic creatures. During a storm, Chun is tangled in a fishing net near the boy\u0026rsquo;s house, and the boy drowns while freeing her from the net. Chun returns to her world, taking the boy\u0026rsquo;s ocarina with her.\nChun bargains with the Soul Keeper, a resident of her world who collects virtuous departed souls from the human world, to return the boy to life. The Soul Keeper takes half of her lifespan in exchange for giving her the boy\u0026rsquo;s soul, which has manifested in this world in the form of a baby dolphin. She advises her that she must nurture the dolphin to adulthood in order to return the boy\u0026rsquo;s soul to the human world. Qiu, Chun\u0026rsquo;s childhood friend, discovers her undertaking; since beings from the human world are forbidden, he promises to help her keep her task secret. Together, they name the dolphin Kun, after a massive fish of legend.\nChun\u0026rsquo;s mother soon finds Kun and throws him into the sewer. While searching for Kun, Chun and Qiu meet the rat matron, who collects the souls of sinners from the human world, which manifest in the form of rats. She takes an interest in the dolphin and summons her rats to recover him from the sewer.\nLater, Chun and Qiu manage to take Kun away before he is narrowly discovered by the villagers. In their search for a new home for the dolphin, Qiu is bitten by a two-headed snake. Chun\u0026rsquo;s grandfather draws the venom into his own body to save Qiu\u0026rsquo;s life. Before succumbing to the venom, he confides in her that he will support her in her task even in death. After his passing, his soul manifests in the form of a begonia tree.\nAs Chun\u0026rsquo;s world begins to experience unnatural torrential rains and snowfall, her family and the local elders realize that Kun\u0026rsquo;s continued presence has caused these phenomena. One night, after Chun confesses to Qiu that she traded away half her lifespan, Qiu receives a warning from the rat matron to hide Kun. He puts Kun in a frozen lake in order to save Chun from further persecution, but Chun dives in after Kun. The rat matron summons her rats to recover Chun and Kun from the icy water, and takes the ocarina from Chun, planning to use it to secure her own passage to the human world.\nAs Chun continues to watch over Kun, Qiu visits the soul keeper to bargain his own life for the return of Chun\u0026rsquo;s. The soul keeper demands his entire lifespan as payment, while warning that Chun will still die regardless when Kun returns to the human world. The soul keeper reveals to Qiu how to save Chun from this fate.\nThe residents of Chun\u0026rsquo;s world gather to kill Kun and avert further calamity. Qiu arrives and performs the ritual to open a portal to the human world, but Kun is unable to swim through it, while the rat matron arrives and uses the ocarina to pass through the portal. Holes in the sky begin to open uncontrollably, flooding Chun\u0026rsquo;s world with sea water from the human world.\nChun is reminded that her actions to save Kun are dooming the people of her own world; she tries to help them evacuate from the flood, but is spurned by all, including her mother. As a last resort, Chun sacrifices herself, merging her body with her grandfather\u0026rsquo;s begonia tree to grow it to colossal proportions, plugging the holes in the sky and saving everyone from the flood.\nKun breaks a branch off the begonia tree and brings it to the soul keeper, who restores Chun to life from it. She sets her on a pilgrimage to return Kun to his world; along the way, they find Qiu, who joins them. Qiu asks her whether she would like to live in the human world herself, but, overwhelmed with regret in knowing they are spending their last night together, is unable to express his feelings for her.\nThe next day, Chun bids Kun farewell as Qiu opens one last portal for his return. At the same time, Qiu, following the soul keeper\u0026rsquo;s instructions, casts a spell that will send Chun to the human world while killing him by setting him on magical fire. As he burns away, Qiu tells her that when she sees the wind and rain to think of him and he\u0026rsquo;ll be with her always. Chun is transformed into a red dolphin, allowing her to follow Kun through the portal.\nOn a seashore in the human world, Kun and Chun wash ashore in their human forms. As Kun comes to, he sees Chun holding out her hand to him.\nIn a mid-credits scene, the soul keeper restores Qiu to life from his ashes and declares Qiu her successor, revealing the true cost of Qiu\u0026rsquo;s sacrifice for Chun.\n","date":1571529600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1571270400,"objectID":"99e90f08077287a51c97bc41907a5811","permalink":"https://luoyeguigenno1.github.io/post/kalimba/","publishdate":"2019-10-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/kalimba/","section":"post","summary":"Play a piece of music named Big Fish with Kalimba.","tags":["Kalimba"],"title":"Big Fish","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Academic Academic | Documentation\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;\rif porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;:\rprint(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)\r  Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}}\r{{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}}\r{{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}\r Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \n A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}}\r- Only the speaker can read these notes\r- Press `S` key to view\r{{% /speaker_note %}}\r Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/media/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}\r{{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}\r{{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}\r  Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1,\r.reveal section h2,\r.reveal section h3 {\rcolor: navy;\r}\r  Questions?

Despite recent success in exploiting robots to perform injection of cells, embryos, and small animals, it remains challenging to automatically achieve intracardial agent injection due to its inaccessible position, inappropriate immobilization force, and inaccurate localization. Here my labortory develops a high-throughput in vivo heart injection system which enables intracardial agent delivery of a single zebrafish larva in less than fifty seconds. This system not only consistently orients the zebrafish to a pre-designed posture but also provides a controllable capture and injection technique to regulate the deformative injury. Horizontal projection and space height of zebrafish heart are determined with micrometer resolution. To illustrate the power of our system, we have injected several classes of agents and analyzed the results which correlate well with known mechanisms of actions in mammals.\nThis video illustrates the workflow of the algorithm here (updated in 07/2019): \nThe device and schematic of the micromanipulation system is shown in the following picture. The objective of zebrafish larva morphology analysis algorithm is to\n detect the larval posture; extract its orientation and belly direction; give visual feedback to the mechanical device to rotate the object to the desired posture; calculate the inhaling position and drive the manipulator to capture the object.  The difficulties inlude\n uneven illumination; noise distractions, such as bubbles, excretion, and small particles, which could cause troubles for extracting the contour of the object; morphological variations for different objects with various ages, sizes, contours; requirements for high processing speed, which means the visual feedback algorithm needs to achive a bandwith of at least 40 fps.  This algorithm used a range of traditional image processing techniques to achieve robust, accurate, and fast morphology analysis. The workflow is illustrated as follows:\n Select the region of interest (ROI) Denoise with Gaussian filter and Gaussian filter and Gaussian bilateral filter, where the point is how to cancel the noise without eroding the contour. Confronted with this difficulty, I combine two types of filter. Adaptive thresholding to extract the foreground while address the uneven illumination. Median filterring and contour extraction. Cut the contour into two parts, compare the curvatures of each one to determine the belly side. Calculate the direction and the degree needed to rotate the object to the desired posture. The mechanical device, a stepper motor, drives the object into the ultimate position with P control. Reach the desired podture. Adaptive thresholding. Median filterring. Contour extraction. Calculate the inhaling position, painted in a red point.  This algorithms achieves\n success rate: 98% for larvae aged between 1 dpf to 4 dpf. accracy: \u0026lt;3 deg.(orientation) \u0026lt;5 pixels (inhaling point) bandwidth: \u0026gt;40 fps  It works effectively for larvae aged between 1 to 4 dpf with various morphological features. Furthermore, this project has applied for 4 patents.\n Supervisor: Prof. Huijun Gao, IEEE Fellow and Professor of Department of Automation, Harbin Institute of Technology\n","date":1543708800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1543708800,"objectID":"1eb24b81db94dc5267ec6403fdbd5d4f","permalink":"https://luoyeguigenno1.github.io/project/zebrafish-larvae-morphology-analysis/","publishdate":"2018-12-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/zebrafish-larvae-morphology-analysis/","section":"project","summary":"In this project, an image processing algorithm for zebrafish larval mophological analysis was designed, which has been put into parctice in zebrafish larva microjection system.","tags":["Computer Vision","Robotics"],"title":"Zebrafish Larva Morphology Analysis","type":"project"}]
